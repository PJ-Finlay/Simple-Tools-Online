SEO
Places to try to get a link:
http://toolstohelpyou.com/
http://www.martindalecenter.com/Calculators.html
http://mathfest.wikispaces.com/Online+Calculators
-Do something like this: http://www.calculator.net/calculators-for-your-site.html and get links by having people include calculator on their site
-Look up links of competing sites and say that your site could "provide more value to their users"
-Look into fiverr seo and backlink gigs
-Email stats

Monetization:
I could consider a monitization model like this selling the tools for people to put on their website:
